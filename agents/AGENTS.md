action-plan: `Generate a prioritized action plan from LLM experiment results following the Analyze-Measure-Improve lifecycle`
annotation-workflow: `Set up human annotation queues for evaluator validation, labeling, and quality assurance`
audit-evaluation-pipeline: `Audit an existing LLM eval pipeline and produce a prioritized diagnostic report with concrete next steps`
build-agent: `Design, create, and configure an orq.ai Agent with tools, instructions, knowledge bases, and memory`
build-evaluator: `Create validated LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators following evaluation best practices`
curate-dataset: `Clean, deduplicate, balance, and augment existing evaluation datasets for higher quality experiments`
evaluate-agent: `Evaluate agentic and tool-calling LLM pipelines with stage-specific graders and transition failure matrices`
evaluate-conversation: `Evaluate multi-turn conversation quality with session-level, turn-level, and memory/coherence checks`
evaluate-rag: `Evaluate RAG pipelines by separately measuring retrieval quality and generation faithfulness`
feedback-loop: `Set up and analyze user feedback collection to drive data-informed improvement cycles`
generate-synthetic-dataset: `Generate structured, diverse evaluation datasets using the dimensions-tuples-natural language method`
knowledge-base: `Manage orq.ai Knowledge Bases — create, configure, upload files, chunk content, search, and maintain RAG data sources via API`
list-models: `List available models and systematically compare them on cost, latency, and quality to find the optimal choice for your use case`
manage-deployment: `Configure, version, and manage orq.ai deployments — model selection, prompt linking, fallbacks, caching, and guardrails`
manage-memory: `Create and configure orq.ai Memory Stores for persistent context in conversational agents`
monitor-production: `Analyze production trace data for anomalies, cost trends, latency regressions, and emerging failure modes`
optimize-prompt: `Systematically iterate on a prompt deployment using trace data, A/B testing, and structured refinement techniques`
prompt-learning: `Automatically improve prompts by collecting feedback, generating "If [TRIGGER] then [ACTION]" rules via a meta-prompt, and validating with multi-judge experiments`
regression-test: `Run a quick regression check against a golden dataset to verify recent changes haven't degraded quality`
run-experiment: `End-to-end LLM evaluation workflow — error analysis, dataset creation, experiment execution, result analysis, and ticket filing`
scaffold-integration: `Generate SDK integration code (Python or Node) for orq.ai agents, deployments, and knowledge bases in the user's codebase`
setup-ci-eval: `Set up continuous evaluation in CI/CD pipelines that runs regression tests on every prompt or agent change`
trace-analysis: `Systematic trace reading and failure taxonomy building using open coding and axial coding`
