# Analyze Trace Failures

Systematic methodology for reading LLM traces, identifying failure modes, and building actionable failure taxonomies.

**Companion skills:**
- `build-evaluator` — build automated evaluators for persistent failure modes
- `run-experiment` — measure improvements with experiments (absorbs action-plan)
- `generate-synthetic-dataset` — generate test data when no production data exists
- `optimize-prompt` — optimize prompts based on identified failures

## When to use

Trigger phrases and situations:
- "what's failing?"
- "why are my outputs bad?"
- "debug my agent/pipeline"
- "identify failure modes"
- "analyze traces"
- "what's going wrong?"
- Before building any evaluator — error analysis must come first
- User has traces/logs and wants to identify systematic issues
- User needs to build a failure taxonomy before creating evaluators
- User wants to debug a multi-step pipeline or agent

## When NOT to use

- **Want to run an experiment?** → use `run-experiment`
- **Want to optimize a prompt?** → use `optimize-prompt`
- **Want to build an agent?** → use `build-agent`

### orq.ai Trace Capabilities
- Traces show hierarchical execution trees: LLM calls, tool invocations, knowledge retrievals
- Three views: **Trace view** (execution tree), **Thread view** (conversational), **Timeline view** (temporal/latency)
- Filter and save custom views for recurring analysis patterns
- Human review can be attached directly to individual spans

### orq MCP Tools

Use the orq MCP server (`https://my.orq.ai/v2/mcp`) as the primary interface. All trace operations needed for this skill are available via MCP.

**Available MCP tools for this skill:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_traces` | List and filter recent traces |
| `list_spans` | List spans within a trace |
| `get_span` | Get detailed span information |

## Core Principles

### 1. Read Before You Automate
Never build evaluators, change prompts, or switch models until you've read at least 50-100 traces and understand the failure patterns.

### 2. Focus on the First Upstream Failure
In multi-step pipelines, a single upstream error cascades into downstream failures. Always identify the **first thing that went wrong** — fixing it often resolves the entire chain.

### 3. Let Failure Modes Emerge from Data
Use grounded theory (open coding → axial coding). Do NOT start with a predetermined taxonomy from LLM research papers. Your application's failure modes are unique.

### 4. Binary Labels, Not Scales
When annotating traces, use Pass/Fail per specific criterion. Likert scales (1-5) introduce noise and slow you down.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Collect Traces

1. **Gather traces for analysis.** Target: **100 traces** for theoretical saturation.

   **From production (if available):**
   - Use `list_traces` from orq MCP to sample recent traces
   - Use orq.ai's filtering and custom views to find interesting subsets

   **From synthetic data (if no production data):**
   - Use the `generate-synthetic-dataset` skill to generate diverse inputs
   - Run inputs through the pipeline and collect full traces

   **Trace Sampling Strategies** — choose the right strategy for your situation:

   | Strategy | How | When to Use |
   |----------|-----|-------------|
   | **Random** | Uniform random sample from all traces | Default starting point; establishes baseline failure rate |
   | **Outlier** | Sort by response length, latency, or tool call count; sample extremes | When you suspect edge cases are hiding in unusual traces |
   | **Failure-driven** | Filter for guardrail triggers, error status codes, or negative user feedback | When you know failures exist but don't know the patterns |
   | **Uncertainty** | Sample traces where existing evaluators disagree or score near thresholds | When refining evaluators or investigating borderline cases |
   | **Stratified** | Sample equally across user segments, features, or time periods | When you need representative coverage across dimensions |

   **Mix strategies:** Start with random (50%), then add failure-driven (30%) and outlier (20%) traces for a balanced sample that includes both typical and problematic cases.

2. **Ensure trace completeness.** For each trace, you need:
   - The original user input
   - The final system output
   - All intermediate steps (for agents/pipelines): LLM calls, tool calls with args and responses, retrieved documents, reasoning steps
   - Any metadata: latency, token count, model used, cost

### Phase 2: Open Coding — Read and Annotate

3. **Read each trace and write freeform notes.** For each trace:
   - Read the full trace end-to-end
   - Ask: "Is this output good or bad?" (binary judgment)
   - If bad: "What specifically went wrong?"
   - Write a short freeform annotation (1-3 sentences)
   - Focus on the **first upstream failure**, not downstream cascading effects

   **Track in a simple structure:**
   ```
   | Trace ID | Pass/Fail | Freeform Annotation |
   |----------|-----------|---------------------|
   | abc123   | Fail      | "Dropped persona on simple factual question, responded in plain English" |
   | def456   | Pass      | "Good — maintained character even on technical topic" |
   | ghi789   | Fail      | "Called wrong tool, used search instead of calculator" |
   ```

4. **When stuck articulating what's wrong**, use these lenses as prompts (not forced categories):
   - Hallucination (fabricated facts)
   - Instruction non-compliance (ignored explicit rules)
   - Persona/tone drift (broke character)
   - Tool misuse (wrong tool, wrong args, misinterpreted results)
   - Context loss (forgot earlier information)
   - Over/under-verbosity (too long or too short)
   - Safety/guardrail bypass (responded to disallowed content)
   - Structural errors (wrong format, missing fields)

5. **Stop when you reach saturation.** Continue until:
   - At least **20 bad traces** are annotated
   - New traces stop revealing fundamentally new failure types
   - Typically 50-100 traces, depending on pipeline complexity

### Phase 3: Axial Coding — Structure the Taxonomy

6. **Group freeform annotations into failure modes.** Read through all your notes and cluster similar failures:
   - Some clusters are obvious: "wrong tool" + "hallucinated tool" = **Tool Selection Errors**
   - Some require splitting: "hallucinated facts" vs "hallucinated user intent" are meaningfully different
   - Some require merging: "too casual for luxury client" + "used jargon with beginner" = **Persona-Audience Mismatch**

7. **Use LLM assistance (carefully).** After coding 30-50 traces:
   - Paste your freeform annotations into an LLM
   - Ask it to propose groupings
   - **NEVER accept LLM groupings blindly** — always review and adjust manually
   - The LLM helps spot patterns you missed; you make the final taxonomy decisions

8. **Define each failure mode precisely:**
   ```
   Failure Mode: [Name]
   Description: [1-2 sentence definition]
   Pass: [What "not failing" looks like]
   Fail: [What "failing" looks like]
   Example: [A concrete trace excerpt]
   ```

9. **Ensure failure modes are:**
   - **Non-overlapping** — each trace should clearly belong to 0 or 1 failure mode
   - **Actionable** — knowing this failure exists tells you what to fix
   - **Observable** — two people would agree on whether it applies to a given trace
   - **Small in number** — aim for 4-8 failure modes, not 20+

### Phase 4: Quantify and Prioritize

10. **Label all traces against the structured taxonomy.**
    - Add columns: one per failure mode (binary: 0 or 1)
    - For each trace, mark which failure mode(s) apply
    - Compute **error rates** per failure mode: count / total traces

    ```
    | Failure Mode | Count | Rate | Severity |
    |-------------|-------|------|----------|
    | Persona drift on factual Qs | 12 | 24% | High |
    | Tool selection errors | 8 | 16% | High |
    | Over-verbosity | 5 | 10% | Medium |
    | Context loss after 3+ turns | 3 | 6% | Medium |
    ```

11. **For multi-step pipelines, build a Transition Failure Matrix:**

    Define discrete states for each pipeline stage. For each failed trace, identify the first state where something went wrong.

    ```
    First Failure In →  ParseReq  DecideTool  GenSQL  ExecSQL  FormatResp
    Last Success ↓
    ParseReq              -          3          0       0         0
    DecideTool             0          -          5       0         1
    GenSQL                 0          0          -      12         0
    ExecSQL                0          0          0       -         2
    ```

    Sum columns to find the most error-prone stages. Focus debugging on the hottest cells.

12. **Classify each failure mode for action:**

    | Failure Mode | Classification | Next Step |
    |-------------|---------------|-----------|
    | [mode] | Specification failure | Fix the prompt |
    | [mode] | Generalization failure (code-checkable) | Build code-based evaluator |
    | [mode] | Generalization failure (subjective) | Build LLM-as-Judge evaluator |
    | [mode] | Trivial bug | Fix immediately, no evaluator needed |

### Phase 5: Output and Handoff

13. **Produce the error analysis report:**

    ```markdown
    # Error Analysis Report
    **Pipeline:** [name]
    **Traces analyzed:** [N]
    **Pass rate:** [X%]
    **Date:** [date]

    ## Failure Taxonomy

    ### 1. [Failure Mode Name] — [X%] of traces
    - **Description:** [definition]
    - **Classification:** [specification / generalization / bug]
    - **Example trace:** [ID and excerpt]
    - **Recommended action:** [fix prompt / build evaluator / fix code]

    ### 2. [Failure Mode Name] — [X%] of traces
    ...

    ## Transition Failure Matrix (if applicable)
    [matrix]

    ## Recommended Next Steps
    1. [Highest priority action]
    2. [Second priority]
    3. [Third priority]
    ```

14. **Hand off to companion skills:**
    - Specification failures → fix prompts directly
    - Need test data → `generate-synthetic-dataset`
    - Need evaluators → `build-evaluator`
    - Need improvement measurement → `run-experiment`

### Phase 6: Iterate

15. **Expect 2-3 rounds of refinement:**
    - Round 1: Initial open/axial coding — rough taxonomy
    - Round 2: Refined definitions, edge cases clarified
    - Round 3: Final taxonomy — stable, non-overlapping, actionable
    - Beyond 3 rounds: diminishing returns

## Grader Design Principles (from agent eval best practices)

When analyzing agent traces specifically:

- **Grade outcomes, not paths.** Agents regularly find valid approaches eval designers didn't anticipate. Checking exact tool call sequences is too rigid and brittle.
- **Use isolated graders per dimension.** Don't build one all-encompassing grader. Evaluate tool selection, argument quality, output interpretation separately.
- **Partial credit for multi-component tasks.** A task can partially succeed. Track which components pass/fail independently.
- **Capability vs regression.** Capability evals should start with a LOW pass rate (hard tasks). As they reach 100%, graduate them to regression suites.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It's Wrong | What to Do Instead |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Skipping open coding | Jumping to generic categories from LLM research misses application-specific failures | Read traces, write freeform notes, let patterns emerge |
| Using Likert scales for annotation | Introduces noise, slower, lower inter-annotator agreement | Binary pass/fail per specific failure mode |
| Freezing the taxonomy too early | New traces reveal edge cases needing definition refinement | Keep iterating for 2-3 rounds |
| Excluding domain experts | Non-experts produce superficial/incorrect labels | The person who knows "good output" best should do the analysis |
| Unrepresentative trace sample | Only looking at recent/easy/familiar traces misses real diversity | Sample across time, features, user types, difficulty levels |
| Labeling downstream cascading failures | Overstates failure count, leads to wrong fixes | Always find and label the FIRST upstream failure |
| Building evaluators for every failure mode | Not every failure needs automation | Only automate for persistent generalization failures |
| Not tracking the transition failure matrix | Multi-step pipeline debugging is guesswork | Map failures to specific state transitions for targeted fixes |
